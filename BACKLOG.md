# Backlog — plans not yet started

This is the repo's to-do list. It is tracked and pushed like everything else
(it was briefly gitignored on 2026-08-08 and that was reversed the same day —
a to-do list that only exists on one machine is not a to-do list). Seven items,
each with a plan detailed enough to start from cold. Nothing here has been
implemented.

Baseline as of 2026-08-08: `node tests/run.js` → **532 passed, 0 failed**
across sixteen files.

**Every section was checked against the code on 2026-08-08** and each now ends
with a "Checked against the code" block: corrections where the plan described
something the code does not do, and the file:line hooks each session actually
touches. Read that block before the plan above it — in three sections it
changes what the work is (A1's part list does not fit the form, D's migration
hazard is worse than described, C's open question is answered). The blocks are
code-reading only; nothing in them was verified against the game.

**Suggested order.** E first, and the code check hardened the reason: it is
small documentation work, but two of its four items are now prerequisites
rather than tidying. **E4 before A1** — it decides whether A1 is confirming a
source or replacing a guess. **E2 before A3** — A3 rewrites the `SPREAD` table,
and one of the two gearing tests reads its constant from that table while the
other hardcodes it, so today's 1.3% disagreement would turn into a moving one.
Then A1 (gating matrix) and
A2 (Mechanical/Aero Balance sweep) — cheap, done standing still in the tuning
menu, and they turn two of the biggest house-heuristic guesses into measured
functions. D (discipline naming) next, because it is small and it changes the
vocabulary every other plan is written in. Then B (generative test set),
because it needs A's fixtures to be more than a structural check. C (GitHub
files) is independent and can be done any time. F and G are library
housekeeping rather than code and need Boston at the wheel, so they run on
their own clock — though the shape of what F needs from the app (see F3) is
worth knowing before D lands, since both touch how a build is keyed.

**G3 before F, though.** G is the rule for which names mean "same car" and
which mean "different car in the same family"; F's cull merges names. Culling
an Evo VIII against an Evo X without that rule in hand deletes a real build
and there is no undo.

# A. In-game measurement plan — reverse-engineer it once, stop guessing

## Why this exists

Four tiers of confidence are documented in CLAUDE.md. Tier 4 — "house
heuristics with no external source" — currently covers the ARB multipliers, the
damping ratios, the camber targets, brake-bias-per-width-step, the `vFrac`
scaling for six of seven disciplines, and every `carNotes()` threshold. Tier 3
is FH4/FH5 community work carried forward untested. Searching for outside
confirmation has already been tried and produced nothing usable (see CLAUDE.md
— forums.forza.net is dead, forza.guide and traxion.gg 403, and the AI
summaries are actively wrong about the gearing graph).

The game itself is the only instrument that works. Most of what is unknown can
be read **without driving a lap**, off readouts that are simulation output with
no run-to-run variance.

## Method rules — these are what keep the data worth having

1. **One variable per observation.** Change one slider, read the readouts,
   write the row. If two things moved, the row is discarded, not interpreted.
2. **Type the number, do not photograph it.** The 3.73 gearing disaster came
   out of measuring gear-line spacing off a phone photo taken at an angle.
   Perspective distortion ate the difference between the right model and the
   wrong one. A blurry photo is not a reading.
3. **Readouts over feel, and the Performance panel over lap times.** 0-60,
   0-100, top speed, 60-0 and 100-0 braking, lateral G — all deterministic,
   all returned in about a second per setting. Reserve driving for things no
   panel reports.
4. **Where a lap time is unavoidable** (dirt, cross-country, anything grip- or
   surface-dependent), fix the route, run best-of-5, record all five, and treat
   anything inside the spread of those five as no result. Do not record a
   single run.
5. **Record raw readings, never conclusions.** The row holds what the screen
   said. The interpretation lives in the analysis, where it can be revised
   without re-driving anything.
6. **Every session ends with a committed fixture**, even when nothing changes.
   A session that confirms the current constant is worth exactly as much as one
   that overturns it, and it is worth nothing at all if it is not written down.
7. **A measurement never silently becomes a constant.** Promotion rule below.

## Promotion rule — measurement → shipped constant

1. Fixture file committed first, with provenance (car, date, class, full part
   list, which screen the number came off).
2. A test that asserts the fixture, independent of `compute()` — the way
   `sweep.test.js` does. It must be able to fail if the formula changes.
3. Only then may `compute()` change, and the comment above the constant gets
   the date and the car.
4. **Two cars minimum** before a constant is treated as general. One car gives
   you that car's fit. This is the lesson from `vFrac`: 0.95 was a guess, 1.14
   was overfitted to whichever setting won one metric by 0.035s inside a range
   that spanned 0.12s, and both shipped untested against data already in the
   repo.

## The rig — reference cars

Chosen to span the axes the formulas actually key off (weight, front %,
drivetrain, gear count, class). Pick real cars owned, and record the exact
stat block once in the fixture header.

| slot | wants | why |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | the GR86 already used | continuity with every existing fixture |
| R2 | light FWD hatch, ~2,600 lb, 62%+ front | the FWD diff band and front-heavy ARB split |
| R3 | heavy AWD, 4,200 lb+ | the damping `wNudge` and the ARB weight scaling |
| R4 | mid-engine or rear-engine, front % under 45 | every axle-share formula, from the other side |
| R5 | high-power S1/S2 RWD, 8+ gears | `SPREAD` for a long box, aero at speed |
| R6 | dirt/cross-country capable AWD | the only way to touch the loose-surface constants |

## Sessions, in value-per-minute order

### A1 — Gating matrix (highest value, ~20 minutes, no driving)

The gating matrix is FH5 carryover and **has never been confirmed on an FH6
screen** — and it is load-bearing: it decides which values print and which
prose prints beside them. Two claims are most likely wrong:

- Street/Sport suspension = spring rate + ride height but **no** damping or
  alignment.
- Street/Sport diff = acceleration only, **no** decel.

Procedure, per part tier: fit the part, open the tuning menu, write down
exactly which sliders exist. Cover: suspension stock/street/sport/race (plus
rally and off-road if separate), ARBs stock/street/sport/race and
front-only/rear-only if that is even purchasable separately, diff
stock/street/sport/race/drift/rally/off-road, transmission
stock/street/sport/race, and both aero ends fitted/not.

Deliverable: `tests/data/gating-fh6.json`, then `gates.test.js` and
`compute()`'s gate block updated **together**. If a claim survives, say so in
the fixture — "confirmed 2026-xx-xx" is the whole point.

### A2 — Mechanical Balance and Aero Balance, solved exactly (~40 min, no driving)

The single biggest win available. Mechanical Balance is a **real readout that
responds to the tune**, which means it is a function we can solve for
outright — and once solved, the app stops aiming at 0.55–0.65 with multipliers
inherited from HokiHoshi's FH4-era method and starts *computing* the ARB pair
that lands on the target.

Sweep, on R1, everything else held:

| step | vary | hold | points |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `arF` = 1, 15, 30, 45, 65 | `arR` = 30, springs at default | 5 |
| 2 | `arR` = 1, 15, 30, 45, 65 | `arF` = 30 | 5 |
| 3 | `spF` ±30% | bars at 30/30 | 3 |
| 4 | `spR` ±30% | bars at 30/30 | 3 |
| 5 | ride height F and R, one step each way | everything else | 4 |
| 6 | repeat steps 1–2, 3 points only, on R3 and R4 | — | 6 |

Record Mechanical Balance to every digit the game shows. Questions the data
answers directly: is MB a pure front share of roll stiffness (`kF/(kF+kR)`)?
Do springs enter it, or bars only? Does ride height? Does the car's weight
distribution enter, or is it purely the sliders? Is it linear in the slider
value or in some derived rate?

Same shape for Aero Balance: sweep `aeF` at fixed `aeR` and vice versa, 5
points each, on R1 and R5. Confirms whether AB is simply front downforce share
and whether the 0.42–0.48 house band is even expressible as a slider pair.

Deliverable: `tests/data/balance-sweep.json` + a solved form in a new
`MODEL.md`. Then `compute()` can invert it: given the target band, emit the
bars that hit it, and print the predicted MB next to the ARB values so the
in-game readout becomes a *check*, not a discovery.

### A3 — `SPREAD` tables for every gear count (~20 min, no driving)

`SPREAD[7]` is confirmed against the game's own race box. **4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and
10 are not** — they are invented, and they feed both the per-gear speeds and
`ratioSet()`. Fit a race transmission on cars with each gear count and copy the
default ratios straight off the screen. Six numbers per row, no interpretation.

Deliverable: `tests/data/spread-fh6.json`, `SPREAD` replaced with measured
rows, `gearing.test.js` extended to assert them.

### A4 — The speed constant on a second car (~15 min)

`k = axisMax · fdFit · G_top` holds on the GR86 within 1.5% across all seven
gears. It is pure kinematics so it *should* generalise, but "should" is how
tier-4 constants are born. Repeat on R3 and R5: read the axis maximum, sweep to
the fit, then check three gear endpoints against `k/(FD·G)`.

Also worth settling in the same sitting: does the axis maximum move when the
gearing moves (it should not), and does it move when power parts are fitted (it
probably does — it is described as a property of the car).

### A5 — Tire pressure against tire temperature (~30 min, driving, telemetry)

`PSI` is a per-compound table of house numbers with a weight nudge and a
drivetrain split. Telemetry reports tire temperature per corner, so the target
is directly observable: fix a route, run 3 laps at each of 5 pressures per
axle, record steady-state temperature at the end of the lap. This gives a real
pressure-to-temperature slope per compound, and lets the app say "this will run
hot, start 2 psi lower" instead of handing over a table value.

Do this for at least sport and race slick. Dirt and off-road compounds are
lower value — the surface dominates.

### A6 — Camber against contact-patch temperature (~30 min, driving, telemetry)

Telemetry splits tire temperature inner/middle/outer. That makes the camber
target *measurable* rather than a discipline constant: sweep camber over 5
points per axle and find where inner and outer converge. The existing `out_f` /
`in_f` fix deltas already assume this relationship — this measures its slope so
a single fix step lands correctly instead of always being 0.3°.

### A7 — Braking, objectively (~15 min, no driving)

The Performance panel reports 60-0 and 100-0 distances. Brake balance and
pressure therefore have an objective optimum per car that can be swept without
driving: 5 balance points × 3 pressure points = 15 readings, ~15 minutes. This
kills the `brake-bias-per-width-step` heuristic (currently 1.5% per step, with
no source at all) or confirms it.

Note the panel's braking figures are straight-line only — they cannot see
trail-braking stability, which is what balance actually trades against. So the
sweep sets the floor, and the `entry_us` / `entry_os` fix path still owns the
rest.

### A8 — Differential lock via wheel-speed telemetry (~40 min, driving)

Diff accel lock is Boston's own rule clamped into ForzaTune's band. Telemetry
shows per-wheel speed, so the lock's effect is observable: on a fixed corner
exit, record inner/outer driven-wheel speed difference at 5 lock settings. The
setting where the difference collapses is full lock; the useful range is the
part of the sweep where it is still varying. Also gives the AWD centre split a
real reading.

### A9 — `vFrac` for the other six disciplines (expensive — do last)

Only road is measured. The other six were scaled from it to preserve an
ordering that was itself a guess. Each one needs its own sweep, and for dirt
and cross-country the Performance panel does not measure what matters, so it is
best-of-5 on a fixed route — hours, not minutes. Worth doing eventually;
worth doing only after A1–A4 have paid for themselves.

Cheap partial win available first: even without lap times, the "does every gear
engage" tie-breaker that settled road at 1.00 can be evaluated for every
discipline from the speed constant alone. Any `vFrac` that leaves the top gear
dead on a representative car is wrong regardless of lap time.

## Data format

`tests/data/<topic>-<car>-<yyyy-mm-dd>.json`:

```json
{
  "car": "2022 Toyota GR86", "class": "A", "pi": 700,
  "date": "2026-08-08", "screen": "tuning menu / Performance panel",
  "build": { "tires": "sport", "susp": "race", "arb": "both",
             "diff": "race", "trans": "race", "aero": "both",
             "twf": 0, "twr": 0, "gears": 7 },
  "held": { "arR": 30, "spF": 480, "spR": 460 },
  "varied": "arF",
  "rows": [ { "arF": 1, "mb": 0.41 }, { "arF": 15, "mb": 0.48 } ],
  "notes": "readout to 2dp; no driving"
}
```

One `varied` key per file. If two things moved, it is two files or it is
nothing.

## Checked against the code, 2026-08-08

**1. The gate A1 is testing is `index.html:1215–1224`, and it is nine lines.**
Worth reading before the screen check so the reading maps onto something:

```
const S=i.susp||'race', full=['race','rally','offroad'].includes(S);
if(S==='stock'){ ['spF','spR','rhF','rhR'].forEach(k=>raw[k]=null); }
if(!full){ ['reF','reR','buF','buR','camF','camR','toeF','toeR','cast'].forEach(k=>raw[k]=null); }
```

So street/sport keep springs and ride height and lose damping *and* alignment —
including caster, which is the part most likely to be wrong, since caster is not
obviously a suspension-tier unlock. Diff gating is `:1041–1042`. Both of A1's
"most likely wrong" claims are one `if` each; the edit, once measured, is small.

**2. A1's part list does not fit the form, and that is the bigger half of the
job.** The procedure says to cover suspension, ARB and transmission across
stock/street/sport/race. The form does not have those options:

- Transmission (`index.html:385–388`) offers **stock/sport/race**, with Stock
  and Street collapsed into one option labelled "Stock / Street". If the screen
  check finds Street unlocks something Stock does not, this needs a fourth
  option and a new gate branch, not a one-line change.
- Anti-roll bars offer **stock / Race front only / Race rear only / Race both**
  — there is no street or sport ARB tier in the form at all. If those tiers
  exist in FH6 and gate differently, the same applies.

Neither is hard, but "20 minutes, no driving" covers the *reading*. Budget the
edit separately.

**3. A2's ride-height sweep is in percent, not millimetres.** `VMETA.rhF/rhR`
are `% of range`, `lo:0 hi:100` (`index.html:553–554`). The app never knows the
car's real ride-height range, so record the percentage the slider was set to
*and* whatever absolute figure the game shows beside it, or the rows will not
generalise to a second car.

**4. A3 will move one test and not the other.** `sweep.test.js` derives its
speed constant from the app's own table — `const K = AXIS * FIT * X.SPREAD[7][6]`
(`:78`, `:91`) — while `gearing.test.js:177` hardcodes `159 * 4.575 * 0.82`.
Replacing the `SPREAD` rows (`index.html:527–535`) therefore silently moves
`sweep.test.js`'s constant and leaves `gearing.test.js`'s where it is. Settle E2
first; it is the same defect and it makes A3 safe.

**5. A3's row 7 is the only measured one, and the other six are visibly
interpolated.** Reading `SPREAD` down the column, the tables are smooth in a way
real race boxes are not — 4 through 10 look generated from a curve, with 7
swapped in when it was measured. Treat all six as unmeasured, not as
approximations that might be close.

**6. A7 has its fields already.** `VMETA.bal` is `% front, lo:30 hi:70` and
`VMETA.pres` is `%, lo:50 hi:150` (`:561–562`), so the 5×3 sweep grid maps
straight onto legal values. The heuristic it is testing is brake-bias-per-
width-step, which is `wStep`-driven and nothing else — see B's brake invariant.

# B. "Works for any car" — the generative test plan

## What today's suite does and does not cover

532 assertions, and the structural sweeps (684 builds, 2,304 gated-part
combinations, plus monotonicity) already prove a lot: in-range for the real
sliders, finite, bump ≤ rebound, nothing crashes, every render path treats
`null` as not-adjustable. What none of it proves is **calibration** — CLAUDE.md
says it outright: shift every ARB by 10× and the whole suite still passes.

So this plan has two halves that must not be confused. Layers 0–2 are
*self-consistency*: they catch a formula contradicting itself or its own
documented intent. Only layers 4–5 can catch a formula that is internally
consistent and wrong about the game, and those need Plan A's fixtures. Writing
layer 1 and calling the calibration problem solved is the trap.

## Layer 0 — input space, defined once

The generator needs a written domain per field, with the joint constraints
spelled out, because the interesting bugs live in combinations no realistic car
has.

| field | realistic | adversarial edges |
|---|---|---|
| `wt` | 1,400–5,500 lb | 900, 8,000 |
| `fw` | 38–65 % | 20, 80 (the form's own clamp) |
| `hp` | 60–1,500 | 25, 3,000 |
| `tq` | 60–1,200 | 25, 2,000 |
| `cls` | D…X | every one, stratified |
| `disc` | all seven | every one, stratified |
| `dt` | RWD/FWD/AWD | all three × all seven disciplines |
| `gr` | 4–10 | all seven counts |
| `tire` | all eight | including mismatched (slicks on cc) |
| widths | 0–3 per axle | 0/3 and 3/0, the two extremes of `wStep` |
| part tiers | full matrix | already swept by `gates.test.js`; reuse it |
| `fdfit` | 2.0–7.0 | absent, 0, 12 |
| `vgraph` | 60–300 mph | absent, 5, 500 |
| `fdset` | 2.0–7.0 | absent, out of slider range |

**Stratify, do not just randomise.** Pure random sampling will run thousands of
A-class RWD road builds and never touch a 10-speed FWD drift car. Cover the
cross product of (discipline × drivetrain × gear count) at least once each,
then fill the remaining budget randomly.

Seeded PRNG (xorshift32, seed printed on every run, `SEED=` env to reproduce).
On failure, shrink: bisect each numeric field toward the class median and
re-test, print the minimal failing input as a pasteable object literal.

## Layer 1 — invariants that must hold for every generated car

Grouped by subsystem. Each is a property, not a value, so none of them
tautologically re-implements `compute()`.

**Springs.** Rate strictly increases with weight, all else equal. Front rate
increases with `fw`, rear decreases. F/R rate ratio tracks the axle-load ratio
within a stated tolerance. Frequency rises monotonically with class. Fitting
aero raises both rates. Nothing ever leaves 20–3,000 lb/in.

**Damping.** Rebound is monotone in axle share. Bump is 0.63 × rebound after
snapping, on both axles, on every build where both exist. Nothing pins to 20 —
assert a *margin*, e.g. no realistic car exceeds 18.5, which is the regression
guard for the 4,800 lb car that came out at 19.2. Loose-surface disciplines are
strictly higher than tarmac at equal weight.

**ARBs.** The pair is proportional to axle load before the discipline trim.
Drift's front bar is far softer than its rear; road's are near-neutral. Sum
rises with weight. Every value lands on a 0.1 grid (already covered by
`arb.test.js` — extend it to generated cars rather than duplicating).

**Pressure.** Front/rear split has the sign the drivetrain implies (FWD front
higher, RWD rear higher-loaded therefore lower front delta, AWD nearly even).
Drag is the documented exception and must stay 50/15. Everything inside 10–55.

**Alignment.** Camber is negative on every tarmac discipline and less negative
on loose. Front camber tracks `fw`. Caster is constant per family — assert it
does not drift when unrelated fields move.

**Brakes.** Balance responds **only** to `wStep`, and 0/0 must equal 3/3
exactly. This is the property that documents the surprising behaviour the form
now explains in words.

**Diff.** Accel lock falls as torque rises and rises with weight, monotone in
both. FWD is strictly below RWD on the same stat block. Every tier gates to the
right set of non-null fields — cross-check against `gates.test.js` rather than
restating it.

**Gearing.** The kinematic identity `speed(G) = k/(FD·G)` holds for every gear
of every generated car. Gear speeds are strictly decreasing in ratio. `fdBand`
brackets `fd` whenever it exists. A user-set final drive is always the one every
downstream figure is computed at — regenerate the whole card at `fdset` and
assert nothing anywhere references the recommendation. No check anywhere
compares a user measurement to a setting the user is not running (the
regression guard for the "it keeps saying something is wrong" cycle).

**Global.** Every non-null output is finite, inside `VMETA` lo/hi, and lands on
the `s` grid. No output is `NaN`, `-0`, `undefined`, or the string `"null"`
anywhere in any render path. (The sweeps cover much of this today; the point is
to run it over *generated* inputs rather than an enumerated list.)

## Layer 2 — per-discipline signature matrix

This is the "test each discipline" half, and it is what stops a refactor
quietly turning a drift tune into a road tune. For each of the seven, assert a
signature: a small set of relationships that are true of that discipline and
false of at least one other, evaluated on the same reference car.

| discipline | signature assertions |
|---|---|
| Road / Circuit | ARB pair near-neutral; `vFrac` 1.00 → recommendation equals the fit; camber most negative of the tarmac set after touge; every gear engages at the recommendation |
| Sprint | softer than road on both springs; longer gearing than road; lower decel lock |
| Touge | softest tarmac springs; largest front/rear ARB gap of the tarmac set; ride height raised; shortest tarmac gearing |
| Drift | front ARB far below rear; accel lock 92; RWD-only warning fires on anything else; 6+ gears warns; rear camber least negative |
| Drag | pressures exactly 50/15; aero suppressed entirely at both ends; accel lock 95; decel 0; camber near zero |
| Dirt | springs under two-thirds of road; ride height high; damping offset applied; non-dirt tires warn; non-AWD warns |
| Cross-Country | softest springs of all; highest ride height; off-road tires required; max width advised; centre split 50 |

Each row is also a *contrast* test: assert the pairwise ordering (cc softer
than dirt softer than touge softer than road) rather than absolute numbers, so
a global recalibration does not have to rewrite the file.

## Layer 3 — golden snapshots, honestly labelled

A committed snapshot of full `compute()` output for ~24 corpus cars. This
catches unintended change and nothing else — it is a **drift detector, not a
correctness check**, and the file should say so at the top so nobody
regenerates it and believes something has been verified. Regeneration is a
deliberate command (`node tests/golden.js --update`) that prints a diff summary
and requires the diff to be read.

## Layer 4 — the real-car corpus

~24 hand-entered real cars spanning D→X, 1,400–5,500 lb, all three drivetrains,
4–10 gears, all seven disciplines represented. Each entry carries the stat
block, the intended discipline, and **expected output bands with a citation**
for where the expectation came from.

Honest status: until Plan A runs, almost every "expected band" would be this
repo's own formula reflected back, which is worthless. So build the corpus
structure now, populate the stat blocks now, and leave the expectation column
empty and clearly marked `unverified` until a measurement fills it. An empty
column that says "we do not know this" is a working document; a column filled
with the formula's own output is a lie that passes.

## Layer 5 — calibration guards from measured data

The `sweep.test.js` pattern, one file per Plan A session. Each holds measured
rows as a fixture and asserts that whatever the constants are now, they still
produce an answer the game actually liked. This is the only layer that can
catch a 10× ARB error, and it can only ever cover what has been measured.

## "Our own physics system" — what that should and should not mean

The instinct is right, with one hard limit already established (CLAUDE.md, "Why
there is no simulator"): the kinematics generalise and were successfully
reverse-engineered; the performance figures cannot be, because six points on
one car underdetermine the model and the derived constants contradict each
other by 10%. Do not build a lap simulator. The game returns exact figures in a
second; rebuilding that badly is worse than telling the user which three
numbers to read.

What to build instead:

- **`MODEL.md`** — the physics spec in prose and equations, separate from the
  code: what each formula claims about the game, which tier of evidence it sits
  on, and what measurement would move it up a tier. Effectively the tier list
  from CLAUDE.md, expanded to one entry per constant with an owner and a
  status.
- **Solved sub-models where a readout exists.** MB and AB (A2) are genuinely
  solvable to an equation, because the game shows the answer. Gear speeds
  already are. These are the parts of "their physics" we can actually own.
- **Explicit unknowns.** Everything not solvable gets a named gap in `MODEL.md`
  with the experiment that would close it. A gap that is written down is a
  backlog item; a gap that is not is a constant nobody remembers is a guess.

Keep it a spec plus fixtures, not a second implementation. Two implementations
of the same wrong idea agree with each other perfectly.

## Implementation notes

New files: `tests/gen.js` (seeded generator + shrinker, shared), `props.test.js`
(layer 1), `disc.test.js` (layer 2), `golden.test.js` + `tests/golden.json`
(layer 3), `corpus.test.js` + `tests/data/corpus.json` (layer 4). Layer 5 files
arrive one per measurement session.

Keep the default suite under ~10 seconds — `FUZZ=250` by default, `FUZZ=20000`
for a deep run before a release. `run.js` needs no change beyond passing the
env through; it already aggregates whatever each file prints.

## Checked against the code, 2026-08-08

**1. Front % is not clamped, it is rejected.** Layer 0 lists "20, 80 (the
form's own clamp)" as adversarial edges. There is no clamp — `index.html:2474`
*refuses to compute at all* outside 20–80 and returns null with a message. So a
generated `fw` of 19 exercises the validator and never reaches `compute()`. Two
consequences: the generator must call `compute()` directly rather than through
the read-and-validate path if it wants out-of-range coverage, and 20 and 80
themselves are the interesting cases because they are inclusive-passing
boundaries.

**2. Build the generator's field list from `FIELDS` (`index.html:2312`), not by
hand.** It is the list both stores and the restore path already iterate. A
hand-written domain table silently stops covering a field the moment one is
added, which is exactly the failure this plan exists to prevent.

**3. Three layer-1 invariants are confirmed as written; do not soften them.**
`wStep = twr − twf` is the only thing brake balance responds to, so layer 1's
"0/0 must equal 3/3 exactly" holds by construction and is worth asserting
precisely because it looks like a bug. Drag's `pF=50, pR=15` is a hard override
at `index.html:1000` and both values sit inside `VMETA` lo/hi, so they survive
snapping unchanged. The stated ranges match `VMETA` exactly: springs 20–3,000,
pressures 10–55, damping ceiling 20.

**4. One layer-1 invariant is close to a tautology.** "Every non-null output
lands on the `s` grid" is enforced centrally in one line — `v[k] = raw[k]==null
? null : snap(k, raw[k])` (`:1227`) — so over generated *inputs* it re-tests
`snap()` and little else. The version with teeth is the one `arb.test.js`
already does: the grid surviving the **fix-delta** path, where multiplicative
deltas stack. Point the generated cars at `applyDeltas()`, not just `compute()`.

**5. Layer 0's `gr` domain is right and needs no edge cases.** The form offers
exactly 4–10 (`index.html:391–394`) and `SPREAD` has exactly those seven keys,
so there is no out-of-range gear count reachable. Stratify across all seven —
skip the adversarial column here.

**6. Layer 3 has a `null` trap.** Golden snapshots must preserve the difference
between `null` (not adjustable on this build) and `0`. `JSON.stringify` keeps
`null`, so this works by default — but any "tidy up the snapshot" pass that
strips nulls or coerces them to `0`/`""` destroys exactly what `locked.test.js`
exists to protect. Say so at the top of the golden file alongside the
drift-detector warning.

# C. GitHub suggested files

The repo is public (it serves GitHub Pages), so GitHub's community-standards
checklist applies and several of these are visible gaps. Nothing here changes
app behaviour.

**Decide first: does this repo want contributors?** If not, half the list is
theatre — `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a code of conduct on a repo that will never
take a PR are noise. The recommendation is: ship the ones that protect the
work (license, CI, `.gitattributes`) and the ones that make *Boston's own*
bug reports structured (issue forms), and skip the social ones until someone
other than Boston opens a PR.

### Worth doing

- **`LICENSE`** — `package.json` says `UNLICENSED`, so the current state is
  "all rights reserved by default, on a public repo." That is a legitimate
  choice but it should be explicit. If it stays closed, add a short
  `LICENSE` saying so and leave the field as is. If it opens up, MIT and update
  `package.json` to match. Right now the repo and the manifest disagree by
  omission.
- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`** — the suite is a single dependency-free
  `node tests/run.js` that exits non-zero on failure. CI is ~10 lines:
  `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node` at 20, run the tests. Trigger on
  push to `main` and on PRs. This is the highest-value file in the section:
  the whole "run the tests before and after every change" discipline currently
  depends on remembering.
- **`.gitattributes`** — Windows working copy, single HTML file that
  everything diffs against. `* text=auto eol=lf` prevents a stray CRLF commit
  turning into a 2,796-line diff.
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/calibration.yml`** — the project-specific one, and
  genuinely useful. A form that requires the stat block (car, year, class,
  discipline, weight, front %, hp, torque, drivetrain, gears, part tiers), the
  value the app produced, what the game or the track actually said, and which
  screen it was read off. Every calibration report in this repo's history has
  been a chat message; a form makes them fixtures.
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml`** — plain bug form: browser, device,
  steps, what happened. Set `blank_issues_enabled: false` in `config.yml` so
  the calibration form is the default path.
- **`.github/pull_request_template.md`** — three checkboxes that match the
  rules already in CLAUDE.md: tests run before and after, calibration
  sanity-checked by hand if a `compute()` formula moved, mobile media query
  still last in `<style>`.

### Probably worth doing

- **`SECURITY.md`** — trivially short for a static single-file page with no
  backend and no dependencies ("no server, no data leaves the device, report
  anything to <email>"), but it is one of the checklist items GitHub surfaces
  and it takes two minutes.
- **`.editorconfig`** — two-space indent, LF, final newline. Matches what is
  already in the file and stops an editor reformatting 2,796 lines.
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`** — there are no npm dependencies, so this is
  only worth it for `github-actions` updates once the workflow above exists.

### Skip for now

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `FUNDING.yml`, discussion
  templates, `CODEOWNERS` on a single-author repo. Revisit if anyone else ever
  opens a PR.

### One thing to check while in there

The Pages build currently publishes from `main` automatically. Confirm whether
that is the legacy branch-based deploy or a workflow; if a test workflow is
added, it is worth knowing whether a red build can still publish. It can, on
branch-based deploys — which may be fine (a broken page beats a stale one is
arguable either way) but should be a decision rather than a surprise.

## Checked against the code, 2026-08-08

**1. The open question above is answered: it is the branch-based deploy.**
There is no `.github/` directory in the repo at all, so there is no workflow
for Pages to be running. A red test workflow will therefore **not** block
publication — the two are unrelated pipelines. Still worth a five-second look
at Settings → Pages to confirm the source reads "Deploy from a branch", but the
absence of any workflow file settles it in practice. If blocking is wanted, the
deploy has to move to a Pages *workflow* with the test job as a dependency,
which is a bigger change than the ten-line CI file described above and should
be its own decision.

**2. Every "worth doing" file is genuinely absent.** Confirmed by listing: no
`LICENSE`, no `.github/` (so no workflows, no issue templates, no PR template),
no `.gitattributes`, no `.editorconfig`. `package.json` still says
`"license": "UNLICENSED"`. Nothing in this section is half-done, so there is no
merge hazard — it is all net-new files.

**3. The `.gitattributes` argument is stronger than the section makes it
sound.** `index.html` is **2,796 lines** and is the file every diff lands in. A
single CRLF round-trip from the Windows working copy rewrites all of it, and
the review cost falls entirely on the one file where review actually matters.
Of the six "worth doing" items this is the cheapest and the one with a concrete
failure mode already in reach.

**4. The calibration issue form should mirror the fixture schema in A, not
invent its own.** Section A already specifies `tests/data/<topic>-<car>-<date>.json`
with `car / class / pi / date / screen / build / held / varied / rows`. If the
form's fields are the same names in the same order, a filed report transcribes
into a fixture mechanically. If they drift, every report needs re-keying by
hand, which is how a report ends up staying a chat message.

# D. Discipline naming and the circuit/sprint distinction

## What is wrong now

The internal keys and the labels both drifted from what the game calls things:

| key | current label | should be (verify on screen) |
|---|---|---|
| `rally` | Dirt Rally | **Dirt** |
| `cc` | Cross-Country | Cross Country — label already right, key is fine |
| `road` | Road / Circuit | Road Racing, probably |
| `sprint` | Sprint / Speed Race | check what the game actually calls this |
| `touge` | Touge | not an FH event family — a real distinction, but ours |
| `drift` | Drift | fine |
| `drag` | Drag | fine |

Tire compounds are a separate vocabulary from event families and may
legitimately differ — the compound may still be called "Rally" and "Off Road"
even if the event is called Dirt and Cross Country. Confirm both lists
separately; do not assume one implies the other.

**Step one is a screen check, not an edit.** Open the event list and the
upgrade shop and write down the exact strings. This whole item is a
transcription task and it is only worth doing correctly.

## The migration hazard — read before touching a key

`disc` is **persisted**. `libKey()` builds its key as
`name|year|class|disc` and `fh6lib` entries are stored under it; `planKey()`
does not include `disc`, so the plan store is safe. Renaming the `rally` key to
`dirt` therefore orphans every saved build in the library on every device it
was saved on, silently — the entry stays in localStorage and simply never
matches again.

So:

- **Rename display strings freely.** `DISC[x].n` is presentation and nothing
  keys off it. This alone fixes the actual complaint.
- **If the internal keys are renamed too**, ship a one-time migration that
  rewrites stored keys on load (`rally→dirt`, mapping table, versioned under a
  `fh6libv` marker so it runs once), plus a test that a v1 library survives it.
  `find.test.js` and `planyear.test.js` are the files that will notice.
- Recommendation: rename labels now, leave keys alone. The keys are internal,
  nobody sees them, and the cost of touching them is real.

## Circuit vs sprint — is it a discipline or a modifier?

`road` and `sprint` already exist as separate disciplines with different
constants (`vFrac` 1.00 vs 1.03, softer springs, lower decel). So part of this
is already built and the question is really about layout *within* a family:
circuit versus point-to-point on the same event type.

Two options:

1. **Split further into more disciplines** — more entries in `DISC`. Simple, no
   architecture change, but the list gets long and every new entry is another
   column of unmeasured constants.
2. **An orthogonal layout modifier** — a second field (`circuit` /
   `point-to-point`) that applies a small multiplier set on top of the chosen
   discipline. Cleaner conceptually, and it composes: a dirt sprint and a dirt
   circuit differ the same way a road sprint and a road circuit do.

Option 2 is the better shape, with one hard condition attached.

**Do not ship a field that changes nothing, and do not ship one whose effect is
invented.** The honest failure mode here is adding a selector that multiplies
`vFrac` by 0.97 because that felt right — that is a placebo control, and it is
worse than not having the field, because the user will trust it. Either it is
measured (A9's method: fix a circuit route and a sprint route, sweep the same
car on both, see whether the optimum actually moves) or it ships as a
documented no-op that only changes wording.

What plausibly *does* differ, and is testable: gearing (a sprint with one long
straight wants a taller top gear than a circuit that never reaches it — and
the "does every gear engage" test can evaluate that without lap times),
ride-height and spring compliance over kerbs, and aero (a point-to-point route
with fewer sustained corners pays less for drag). What plausibly does not:
alignment, tire pressure, diff. Scope the experiment to the first list.

Suggested sequence: (1) transcribe the real names off the screen; (2) rename
labels only, keys untouched; (3) add the layout modifier as a UI field wired to
a single constant table where circuit and point-to-point are **identical
values** on day one, with the table commented as unmeasured; (4) measure, then
fill the table. Step 3 with step 4 skipped is the thing to avoid.

`modes.test.js` covers field visibility and will need the new field added to
its matrix; the plan-mode hide list needs a decision too — layout is knowable
before parts are bought, so it belongs in plan mode as well as tune mode.

## Checked against the code, 2026-08-08

**1. The migration hazard is worse than described, in two ways. Read this
before renaming a key.**

*`disc` is not only in `libKey` — it is a stored field value in all three
stores.* `FIELDS` (`index.html:2312`) includes `disc`, and both `libAdd` and
`planAdd` copy every entry in `FIELDS` onto the record. So "`planKey()` does
not include `disc`, so the plan store is safe" is **wrong**: plan entries do not
lose their key, but they carry a stale `disc` string that no longer exists in
`DISC`.

*And the failure is not a silent non-match.* Loading restores values into form
controls with `el.value = v` (`:2381`). Assigning a `<select>` a value it does
not have leaves it unselected — `value` reads `''` — so the build loads with no
discipline. `compute()` opens with `const d = DISC[i.disc]` (`:961`), which is
then `undefined` and throws on the first property access. Depending on which
path the user took, a renamed key is therefore either a **crash** or a build
that quietly comes back as a different discipline. Both are worse than an
orphan, because an orphan is at least visibly missing.

**2. There is a third localStorage key the plan does not account for.**
`fh6last` (written `:2477`, read `:2316`) holds the last-entered form state and
is restored on every load. It stores `FIELDS`, so it stores `disc` too. Any
migration has to sweep `fh6lib`, `fh6plan` **and** `fh6last`, or the first page
load after the rename restores a dead discipline into the form. The omission is
inherited from CLAUDE.md, which describes "two localStorage-backed stores" —
that count is of the *stores*, and `fh6last` is a session-restore, but for a
key rename it is a third place the string lives.

**3. The recommendation stands, and is now better supported: rename labels,
leave keys.** `DISC[x].n` is presentation only. Given points 1 and 2, the key
rename costs a three-store migration plus a version marker plus tests, to change
strings nobody sees.

**4. One correction to the table.** `cc`'s current label is `'Cross-Country'`
with a hyphen (`index.html:519`), while the "should be" column writes
"Cross Country" without one and calls the label already right. If the game's
string has no hyphen, that is still a change — small, but this whole item is a
transcription task, so transcribe it.

**5. "Part of this is already built" is exactly five constants.** Road versus
sprint in `DISC` (`:507–510`) differ only in: spring factors `fF` 1.00→0.98 and
`fR` 0.97→0.95, decel `dec` 15→12, final-drive base `fd` 3.70→3.55, and `vFrac`
1.00→1.03. Nothing else — same camber, same caster, same toe, same ride height.
That is a useful sanity bound on the layout modifier: whatever circuit versus
point-to-point turns out to be worth, it should be smaller than the road/sprint
gap, and it lands on the same short list of constants the existing split
already touches (springs, gearing, decel). It also matches the plan's own
"what plausibly does differ" list, which is reassuring rather than
circular — the two were derived independently.

# E. Loose ends — small, found 2026-08-08, not fixed

Four documentation defects found while auditing the repo (E1–E3 on 2026-08-08,
E4 added the same day from the code check). None breaks anything today; E2 is a
real contradiction in the reference data and should be settled before anyone
leans on the gearing constant again, and E4 is the same species of defect in
the provenance record.

### E1 — CLAUDE.md undercounts the test suite

CLAUDE.md line 33 says "381+ assertions across thirteen files." Actual, as of
2026-08-08: **532 assertions across sixteen files** (`arb`, `find`, `gates`,
`gearing`, `locked`, `modes`, `mono`, `pi`, `planyear`, `review2`, `scan`,
`smoke2`, `smoke3`, `stock`, `stress`, `sweep`). Just stale — update the number
and the file count. Low stakes, one-line fix, but the paragraph is the one that
tells a new session how much cover it has, so an undercount encourages
scepticism where it is not warranted.

### E2 — The reference car's axis maximum is recorded as both 157 and 159

Same car, same screen, two different readings, and the whole gearing model
hangs off it via `k = axisMax · fdFit · G_top`:

- `sweep.test.js:40` — `const FIT = 4.575, AXIS = 157`, asserting k ≈ **589**.
- `gearing.test.js:177` — `const K = 159 * 4.575 * 0.82`, i.e. **596.5**.
- CLAUDE.md uses both: the "no 7th gear visible" observation is on a 159 axis,
  while the 7th-gear-stub example says "6th ran out at 154 on a 157 chart."

Both test files pass because each is internally consistent, which is exactly
why this survived. The gap is 1.3% — small enough that every existing assertion
tolerates it, large enough that it is definitely one misreading and not two
valid numbers.

Fix: re-read the axis maximum off the GR86's gearing screen once, write the
number into a fixture with a date, and make **both** files import it rather
than each carrying its own literal. Worth doing as part of session A4, which is
already going to that screen for the second-car check.

Note for whoever settles it: the axis is described as a fixed property of the
car, but it is not established whether power upgrades move it. If the two
readings were taken at different build states, both could be right and the real
defect is that neither records the build. A4 should check that too.

**Status 2026-08-08: the structural half is done.** Both files now read the
axis through `tests/data/index.js` (`FX.axis(fallback, who)`), which returns
the fixture's confirmed value if there is one and the caller's historical
literal if not, printing an `[UNRESOLVED]` line either way. Filling in
`readings.axisMax` in `tests/data/gearing-gr86-2026-07-31.json` switches both
files at once. All that is left is the reading. Session sheet: `MEASURE.md`.

**And the dry run turned up something the plan did not expect: the two
candidates are not symmetric, and neither is simply the typo.** Both were run
through the suite:

- **157** → `gearing.test.js` fails: 5th at fd 3.73 predicts 143.55 against the
  measured **145.4**, out by 1.85 mph.
- **159** → `sweep.test.js` fails: 2nd at fd 4.82 predicts 60.4 against **59**
  read off the chart, out by 1.4 mph (2.4%, past the 2% tolerance).

Each candidate is contradicted by a different independent measurement, so the
"one misreading, not two valid numbers" framing above is too tidy. The
contradictions are not equally strong, though: 145.4 is a digit readout off the
Performance panel and 59 is a gear endpoint eyeballed off a chart, where ±1 mph
is nothing. That favours **159**, with the gear-2 miss inside chart-reading
error. It is an argument and not a measurement — which is exactly why
`MEASURE.md` asks for the axis to be read cold, before that reasoning is seen.

If the cold reading comes back 157, the next question is whether the 145.4 was
genuinely read off the screen or back-computed from 159 at the time. If it was
back-computed it is not evidence and this whole paragraph collapses.

**Third wrinkle, found in the code check 2026-08-08:** the two files also
disagree about where the *top gear ratio* comes from. `sweep.test.js` reads it
from the app — `const K = AXIS * FIT * X.SPREAD[7][6]` (`:78`, `:91`) — while
`gearing.test.js:177` hardcodes `0.82`. They agree today only because
`SPREAD[7][6]` is 0.82. This makes E2 a prerequisite for **A3**, which replaces
the `SPREAD` rows with measured ones: the moment that table moves,
`sweep.test.js`'s constant moves with it and `gearing.test.js`'s does not, and
the 1.3% disagreement stops being the only difference between them. Settle the
axis, put `FIT`, `AXIS` and the top ratio in one dated fixture, and have both
files import it.

### E3 — CLAUDE.md says the working directory has not been renamed. It has.

Lines 15–17: "The local working directory is still `Forza Tune Builder`;
renaming it is safe but has to happen outside a session, since it is the cwd."
The actual path is now `C:\Users\bston\Projects\forza-tune-goon`, so the rename
already happened and the caveat describes work that is done. Delete the
sentence. Bundle it with E1 — both are one-line staleness in the same file.

### E4 — The gating matrix cites a source CLAUDE.md says does not exist

CLAUDE.md, on the gating matrix: "Audited 2026-07-31 at Boston's request:
ForzaTune's guide does not cover part-to-slider unlocks at all, **and no other
credible source exists.**"

The comment above the gate block says the opposite — `index.html:1206–1207`:
"Gating per the one traceable FH6 source (**Destructoid's slider guide**) plus
FH5 carry-over."

Destructoid appears nowhere in CLAUDE.md, and CLAUDE.md's tier list has no slot
for it. So either the audit missed a source the code has been relying on since
before it, or the comment is stale and the guide was checked and rejected —
and which one it is changes A1's status. If Destructoid genuinely covers FH6
part-to-slider unlocks, the matrix is tier 2 and A1 is a confirmation pass. If
it does not, the matrix is tier 3/4 as CLAUDE.md says and A1 is the only thing
standing between the app and a load-bearing guess.

Fix: open the guide, decide which reading is right, and make the two files
agree — either add it to CLAUDE.md's tier 2 list with what it actually covers,
or delete the claim from the code comment. Ten minutes, no game needed. Do it
before A1 rather than after, because it tells you whether A1 is checking a
source or replacing one.

# F. Library cull, then two tunes per keeper

Asked for 2026-08-08, recorded as a note only. **Nothing here has been started
and nothing should be — Boston is driving this one himself when he gets to it.**
The value of the notes is the keying detail in F1 and the missing delete in F3,
which are easy to not know at the moment you are staring at the list.

## F0 — What was actually said

> "Go through all duplicates and get rid of ones I don't want and create 2
> different tunes for each we actually like."

Two jobs, in order: **cull, then double up.** Asked whether the two tunes would
differ on an axis the key already holds, he confirmed they will — so this is
data entry, not a schema change (see F2). The rest is his call at the time.

One thing worth knowing before the first delete regardless: it is
unrecoverable. localStorage, one device, no backup, no undo.

## F1 — Why there are duplicates at all

`libKey` is `name|year|class|discipline` (`index.html:921`) and `planKey` is
`name|year` (`index.html:941`). Re-saving an exact match overwrites, so the
store cannot hold a true duplicate. Everything Boston is seeing as a duplicate
is therefore one of four things, and they want opposite treatment:

1. **Name-variant collisions** — "GR86" vs "Toyota GR86" vs "toyota gr86 " are
   three keys for one car (the key lowercases and trims but does not normalise
   anything else). These are junk. Merge to whichever name he actually types
   now, delete the rest.
2. **Year variants** — same car saved once with the year and once without;
   `year` is optional and empty-string is a distinct key. Junk, same treatment.
3. **Same car, different class** — a genuine record of two builds, not a
   duplicate. Keep unless he says otherwise.
4. **Same car, different discipline** — likewise genuine, and note that D
   (discipline naming) is going to rewrite these keys anyway. **Do F before D
   or after D, never across it** — culling against key names that are about to
   change wastes the pass.

So the cull is really a *normalisation* pass over 1 and 2 plus a keep/drop
judgement on 3 and 4.

## F2 — "Two different tunes for each we actually like"

For each car that survives the cull, two saved builds that differ on
**discipline or class** — the two axes `libKey` already carries, so they sit
side by side with no code change and the build plan picks both up as reference
points. Confirmed 2026-08-08 that this is the intent; which axis per car is
whatever the car deserves, decided as he goes, not something to systematise up
front.

Worth recording why the question was asked: `libKey` has no slot for a variant
name, so two setups of the *same* car+year+class+discipline overwrite each
other. That case would be a schema change (a `variant` field in the key,
migration for every existing entry, `find.test.js` and `planyear.test.js`
updates) — ruled out, but it is the thing to re-check if the ask ever comes
back as "two setups for the same event."

## F3 — One real gap the cull will hit immediately

**`fh6plan` entries cannot be deleted from the UI.** Library builds have a
two-tap Delete (`index.html:1638`, handler at `:2743`); starting-point entries
have no delete path at all — they are written by Build Plan, surfaced by Find,
and then permanent. A cull that can only remove half the store is not a cull.

Fix: give plan rows the same two-tap Delete, addressed by `planKey`, filtering
`planLoad()` and calling `planStore()` — a near-copy of the existing library
handler. `find.test.js` covers the Find list that renders both, so extend it
there. Small, and it is the only code this whole item needs. Do it when the
cull starts, not before — there is no point having it sat there unused.

## F4 — The one thing to decide at the time

Whether same-car-different-class/discipline entries read as duplicates to cull
or as the keepers. F1 assumes keepers. If it turns out to be the opposite, the
cull is much larger *and* F2's "two tunes" is rebuilding what was just deleted
— so it is worth being sure of on the first car rather than the twentieth.

**Do G3 before this.** The cull renames things, and G is about which names mean
"same car" and which mean "different car in the same family." Culling first
loses that distinction permanently.

---

# G. Nameplate families — many builds, never a "best"

Asked for 2026-08-08, immediately after F. Notes only, nothing started.

## G0 — What was asked

Multiple custom builds for nameplates that have a lot of variants in the game,
explicitly **not** reduced to a best-of. Named directly: Lancer Evolutions,
Civics, the Subarus, the Nissans (GT-R generations and the 350Z), and on the
muscle side Challenger, Mustang, Charger, Camaro, Corvette. "Evolutions and
variants, stuff like those where there's a lot of them" — so this covers two
things that behave the same way here: **generations** of one nameplate (Evo
VIII / IX / X, C5 / C6 / C7 Corvette) and **trim variants** within a generation.

## G1 — This is not F, and F is the thing most likely to destroy it

F's cull includes a normalisation pass that merges name-variant collisions —
"GR86" vs "Toyota GR86" vs "toyota gr86 " are three keys for one car and two of
them are junk. **A family is indistinguishable from that pattern by string
shape.** "Lancer Evolution VIII" and "Lancer Evolution X" share a long prefix
and differ by a short suffix, which is exactly what a typo pair looks like. Run
the cull without a family rule and it eats real cars, irreversibly
(localStorage, one device, no undo).

Two rules that fall straight out of this, and they invert F's:

1. **Inside a family, the year field is a discriminator and never gets
   dropped.** F1 calls year variants junk — same car saved once with the year
   and once without. That is true *between* duplicates of one car and false
   *within* a family, where the year is often the only thing separating two
   entries whose names differ by a Roman numeral.
2. **A suffix difference is a different car until proven otherwise.** Junk
   collisions differ by manufacturer prefix, spacing or case. Genuine variants
   differ by generation marker. When in doubt, keep both — the cost of keeping
   a duplicate is a row in a list; the cost of dropping a variant is a build.

## G2 — The app already does this right, and the work is mostly not regressing it

Two mechanisms exist and neither picks a best:

**Find groups families for free.** The match is a substring test on the name —
`String(b.name||'').toLowerCase().includes(q)` (`index.html:2420`) — so typing
`lancer` already returns every Lancer, `corvette` every Corvette. There is no
family feature to build; there is a naming convention to settle (G3). The
autocomplete is fed the same way and sorts alphabetically (`refreshCarList`,
`:2403`), so consistently-named variants already cluster.

**The build plan's reference list is deliberately unranked.** `peers` is
`libLoad().filter(b => b.cls===i.cls && b.disc===i.disc && b.hp && b.wt)`
(`:821`), rendered as the last five in insertion order, under the heading
"Your finished \<class\> \<discipline\> builds for reference" with the
parenthetical **"(your own data, not a rule)"** (`:1571–1575`). Nothing sorts
it, nothing scores it, nothing calls one better. That parenthetical is the
whole no-best-picking policy, already shipped in four words. Do not remove it,
and do not add an `ORDER BY` to that list.

So the deliverable here is much smaller than the ask sounds: a naming
convention, a rule written down, and a guard. No new feature is required, and
that is the finding, not a dodge.

## G3 — The naming convention (the actual work, and it is a decision not a task)

`libKey` is `name|year|class|disc` and `name` is free text, so a family is only
as real as the string typed into it. The convention needs to satisfy one test:
**the family name must be a substring of every member.** That is what makes
Find's existing behaviour do the grouping.

Working proposal — family first, variant after, year always in the year field:

- `Lancer Evolution VIII` / `Lancer Evolution IX` / `Lancer Evolution X` → all
  match `lancer`
- `Civic Type R` / `Civic Si` → both match `civic`
- `Corvette C5` / `Corvette C6` / `Corvette C7` → all match `corvette`
- `Camaro ZL1` / `Camaro Z28`, `Mustang GT` / `Mustang Boss 302`, and so on

**The Nissans are the case that breaks it, and it needs deciding rather than
guessing.** The R32/R33/R34 are Skyline GT-Rs and the R35 is just GT-R, so
`gt-r` catches all four but `skyline` misses the R35 — while the 350Z shares no
substring with any of them despite being the same manufacturer. Three options:
treat GT-R as the family and accept Skyline as a variant prefix
(`GT-R R34 Skyline`); treat them as two families; or accept that "the Nissans"
is a garage grouping rather than a nameplate family and not force it. The third
is probably right and it is Boston's call.

**Recommendation: convention only, no schema change.** A `family` field in
`libKey` would make grouping explicit, but it is a key change — which per D's
findings means migrating `fh6lib`, `fh6plan` **and** `fh6last`, plus a version
marker and tests. Substring Find already delivers the grouping at zero cost.
Revisit the field only if the convention is tried and demonstrably fails.

## G4 — Where "best" would creep back in, so it can be refused on sight

None of these exist today. Each is a plausible-sounding future change that
would break the thing this item is protecting:

- Sorting `peers` by hp/1000 lb, PI, or anything else. It is insertion order on
  purpose. Sorting a list is how a list becomes a ranking.
- A "your best build in this class" line, or flagging the peer with the highest
  power-to-weight. `carNotes()` already carries qualitative viability flags
  (`:1475`) and describes the car in front of it — it never compares two cars,
  and that boundary is the one to hold.
- Applying F's "get rid of ones I don't want" per-family rather than per-entry.
  The families in G0 are the ones where he wants *more* entries, not fewer.

Rule to write into the code comment beside `peers` if that block is ever
touched: **the app lists, it does not order.**

## G5 — Open, needs Boston

1. Which string is the family for the Nissans (G3), and whether "the Subarus"
   means WRX/STI as one family or several.
2. Whether the multiple builds per family differ by **class** (an A-class Evo
   and an S1 Evo) or by **discipline**, or vary per family. F2 settled this at
   the whole-library level as "discipline or class, decided per car" — a family
   may well want the opposite emphasis, since the interesting comparison
   between three Evos is more likely to be the same discipline at different
   classes than the reverse.

## G6 — First family: the Mitsubishis. Roster given 2026-08-08

Supplied directly, and it settles something G0 got half-right. "Duplicate cars"
does **not** only mean generations of a nameplate — it means **multiple copies
of the identical car in the garage**, each wanting its own build. The counts
below are copies owned, not builds already made.

| car | copies | builds needed |
|---|---|---|
| 1995 Lancer Evolution III GSR | 2 | 2 |
| 2001 Lancer Evolution VI GSR Tommi Mäkinen Edition | 3 | 3 |
| 2004 Lancer Evolution VIII MR | 2 | 2 |
| 2004 Lancer Evolution VIII MR Forza Edition | 2 | 2 |
| 2006 Lancer Evolution IX MR | 1 | 1 |
| 2008 Lancer Evolution X GSR | 1 | 1 |
| 1995 Eclipse GSX | 2 | 2 |

**Thirteen builds across seven distinct cars.**

### The constraint this puts on the key, which is the whole reason it matters

`libKey` is `name|year|class|disc`. Two copies of the same car are, to the app,
the same car — there is no copy number in the key. **So every copy of a given
car must land on a distinct (class, discipline) pair, or the second one
overwrites the first with no warning.** That is not a preference, it is the
storage model. Three copies of the VI TME means three distinct pairs.

If any car ever wants two builds at the *same* class and discipline, that is
exactly the `variant`-in-the-key schema change F2 ruled out — three-store
migration, version marker, tests. The roster below is designed to stay inside
the existing key, which is why it is worth checking before building rather
than after.

### Two names, both confirmed by Boston 2026-08-08

Per G3 the name string *is* the family key, so both were queried before typing.
Both came back settled and the roster above is unchanged:

1. **The "Welcome Edition" VIII MR is a Forza Edition of the car** — a distinct
   car, not a nickname for a second copy of the plain 04 VIII MR. So it keeps
   its own row with two copies and two builds, and the two VIII MR lines stay
   separate. Boston's own term for it is the Welcome Edition; the roster uses
   Forza Edition because that is what makes it a different car, but the string
   that goes in the name field is whatever the garage prints.
2. **The VI TME is a 2001.** Prior Forza titles list the Tommi Mäkinen Edition
   as a 1999 car, which is why it was queried — FH6 says 2001 and the game
   beats the prior-title convention, per CLAUDE.md's rule that a check against
   the actual game beats any outside source. All three copies use `2001`.

**One consequence of the FE being real, worth knowing before building it.**
Forza Edition cars carry a built-in perk and normally sit at a higher stock PI
than the base car. The app has no field for either — `FIELDS` has no perk
concept, and PI is whatever gets typed in. Nothing breaks: the build plan reads
the numbers off the screen like any other car, and the PI budget line will be
correct because it is computed from the entered figure. But no note anywhere
will mention the perk, so the plan cannot account for it. That is a limitation
to know about rather than a gap to fill — a perk field would be one more
unmeasured constant, which is the thing this backlog keeps refusing to add.
It does support the S2 Road allocation below: the FE starts higher, so building
into the class rather than down to it is the cheaper direction.

### Naming, so Find groups them

Family substring `lancer` catches all eleven Evos. Suggested strings:
`Lancer Evolution III GSR`, `Lancer Evolution VI GSR TME`,
`Lancer Evolution VIII MR`, `Lancer Evolution VIII MR Forza Edition`,
`Lancer Evolution IX MR`, `Lancer Evolution X GSR`.

Note the FE string must extend the base car's name rather than replace it, so
that `Lancer Evolution VIII MR` as a search returns **both** VIII MR cars —
four copies, four builds, which is the set worth seeing together. Naming it
`Evo VIII FE` would hide it from that search.

**The Eclipse is not in the Lancer family and should not be forced into it.**
Same manufacturer, different nameplate — `Eclipse GSX`. Searching `lancer`
correctly misses it. This is the concrete case for G5's open question: "the
Mitsubishis" is a garage grouping, "Lancer" is a nameplate family, and the app
only models the second. That is fine and no code should try to fix it.

### Proposed allocation — a starting table, not a recommendation

Every copy gets a distinct pair, so nothing collides. All seven cars are AWD
turbo, which rules one discipline out immediately and makes two others
obvious:

- **No drift builds.** The app fires an RWD-only warning on anything else, so a
  drift Evo means a drivetrain swap — a different exercise, not a variant.
- **Dirt and cross-country are the natural fit** and the Evos are the cars that
  earn those constants an honest test. Note cross-country requires off-road
  tires and advises maximum width.
- **Drag rewards AWD launch**, and drag is the discipline with the most
  distinctive tune signature in the app (pressures forced to 50/15, aero
  suppressed at both ends, decel 0), so it is a useful contrast to hold.

| car | copy | class | discipline | why this one |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Evo III GSR | 1 | A | Road | lightest and oldest — the baseline everything else reads against |
| Evo III GSR | 2 | B | Dirt | low class keeps it period-honest and tests the dirt constants at low power |
| Evo VI GSR TME | 1 | S1 | Road | the halo car at the class where AWD road tunes get interesting |
| Evo VI GSR TME | 2 | A | Dirt | the rally car doing the rally job |
| Evo VI GSR TME | 3 | S1 | Sprint | same class as copy 1, so it isolates road-vs-sprint on one car |
| Evo VIII MR | 1 | A | Touge | tests the softest tarmac spring set on a heavy AWD car |
| Evo VIII MR | 2 | S1 | Drag | AWD launch, and the most distinctive tune signature to eyeball |
| Evo VIII MR FE | 1 | S2 | Road | the FE perk pushes PI up anyway, so build into it |
| Evo VIII MR FE | 2 | A | Sprint | — |
| Evo IX MR | 1 | S1 | Dirt | the dirt build at high power, contrast against the A-class TME |
| Evo X GSR | 1 | S1 | Road | newest chassis against the TME at the same class and discipline |
| Eclipse GSX | 1 | A | Drag | 2G AWD, the obvious drag candidate |
| Eclipse GSX | 2 | B | Road | — |

Two deliberate pairings in there worth keeping whatever else changes, because
they are the only ones that produce a *comparison* rather than just a build:
**TME copy 1 vs copy 3** (same car, same class, road vs sprint — isolates the
discipline constants) and **TME copy 1 vs Evo X GSR** (same class, same
discipline, different chassis — isolates the stat block). Everything else in
the table is a spread rather than an experiment and can be reshuffled freely.

Cross-country is unallocated: it wants off-road tires and max width on a car
that will otherwise be built for tarmac, and thirteen builds is already the
work. Worth adding as a fourteenth on whichever copy is least interesting after
the first pass.
